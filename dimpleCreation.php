                    <h2 class=" fw-bold text-center text-uppercase">What to Expect During the Procedure?</h2>
                   <p class="lh text-center">Our skilled surgeons will begin by marking the precise location of the dimples on your cheeks. The procedure itself is straightforward and usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour under local anesthesia. A small incision is made inside the cheek, and a suture is used to create a depression in the desired location. The incision is hidden inside the mouth, leaving no visible scars.</p>
                  
                   <h2 class=" fw-bold text-center text-uppercase">Recovery and Aftercare</h2>
                   <p class="lh text-center">Recovery from dimple creation surgery is typically quick, with most patients returning to their normal activities within a day or two. You may experience slight swelling or bruising, but this usually subsides within a week. Our team will provide you with detailed aftercare instructions to ensure a smooth recovery and optimal results.</p>
