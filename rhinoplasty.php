                    <p class="lh">Nose Plastic Surgery is a highly individualized procedure that can be performed using either an open or closed technique, depending on the patient’s needs and the surgeon’s approach.</p>
                    <ul class="lh">
                        <li><strong>Open Rhinoplasty:</strong>In this method, a small incision is made on the columella, the tissue between the nostrils, allowing the surgeon to lift the skin and gain better access to the underlying structures. This approach is often used for more complex cases, where significant reshaping or correction is required.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed Rhinoplasty:</strong>In this technique, all incisions are made inside the nostrils, leaving no visible scars. Closed nose job is typically used for less extensive adjustments and is associated with a quicker recovery time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="lh">During the procedure, the surgeon may reshape the nasal bones and cartilage, remove excess tissue, or add grafts to achieve the desired contour. The goal is to create a nose that complements the patient’s facial features while maintaining or improving nasal function.</p>

                    <p class="lh">Recovery from Nose surgery varies depending on the extent of the surgery and the individual patient. Initial swelling and bruising are common but typically subside within a few weeks. Most patients can return to work or school within a week or two, though full healing and final results may take up to a year as the nasal tissues continue to settle.</p>
                    <p class="lh">During the recovery period, it’s essential to follow your Rhinoplasty surgeon’s instructions carefully, avoid strenuous activities, and protect your nose from any potential trauma. Regular follow-up appointments will help ensure that the healing process is on track and that you are satisfied with the results.</p>
                    <p class="lh">
                    <strong>In short</strong>, Nose job is a powerful tool for those looking to enhance their facial harmony or correct functional nasal issues. Because the procedure can be customized to each patient’s unique needs, nose surgery offers long-lasting results that can significantly improve both appearance and quality of life. If you’re considering nose job, consult with a qualified surgeon to explore your options and create a treatment plan tailored to your goals.
