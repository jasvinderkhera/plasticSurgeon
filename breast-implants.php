                    <p class="lh">Breast implants are a popular cosmetic procedure designed to enhance the size, shape, and overall appearance of the breasts. Whether you’re looking to increase volume, restore fullness lost after pregnancy or weight loss, or achieve better symmetry, breast implants can help you achieve your desired look.</p>

                    <p class="lh">Breast implants are placed under the breast tissue or chest muscles to augment the size or shape of the breasts. They come in various types, shapes, and sizes, allowing for a highly customizable approach to breast enhancement.</p>

                    <h2 class=" fw-bold text-uppercase">The procedure</h2>
                    <p class="lh">Breast implant surgery in Gurgaon is typically performed under general anesthesia and takes about 1 to 2 hours. During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision, creates a pocket either under the breast tissue or the chest muscle, and then places the implant inside. The incision is then closed with sutures. The location of the incision can vary depending on the type of implant, your anatomy, and your surgeon’s recommendation. Common incision sites include:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="lh ps-3">
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Inframammary:</strong> Under the breast, along the natural crease.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Periareolar:</strong> Around the edge of the areola.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Transaxillary:</strong>  In the armpit.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Transumbilical (TUBA):</strong>  Through the navel (used less commonly).</li>
                        
                       
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class=" fw-bold text-md-center text-uppercase">Recovery and Results</h2>
                   <p class="lh text-md-center">Recovery from breast implant surgery typically involves some discomfort, swelling, and bruising for the first few days. Most patients can return to work and normal activities within a week, though strenuous activities should be avoided for at least 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
                  
                   <p class="lh text-md-center">The final results of your breast implant surgery will become more apparent as the swelling subsides. The implants will settle into place over the following months, revealing the final shape and size. Scars from the incisions will gradually fade over time.</p>

                    <p class="lh">While breast implants are generally safe, it’s important to be aware of potential risks and complications, including:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="lh ps-3">
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Capsular Contracture:</strong> The formation of scar tissue around the implant, which can cause the breast to feel firm or appear misshapen.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Implant Rupture or Leakage:</strong> The formation of scar tissue around the implant, which can cause the breast to feel firm or appear misshapen.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Changes in Sensation:</strong> Some women experience changes in nipple or breast sensation, which can be temporary or permanent.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Infection:</strong>  As with any surgery, there is a risk of infection, which may require additional treatment or surgery.
                        </li>
                        
                       
                    </ul>
                    <p class="lh">Regular follow-up visits with your surgeon are essential to monitor the condition of your implants and ensure they continue to meet your expectations.</p>
