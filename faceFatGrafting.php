                    <p class="lh mb-5">Face fat grafting, also known as fat transfer or lipofilling, is a cosmetic procedure that involves extracting fat from one part of your body and injecting it into your face. This technique is primarily used to restore volume to areas of the face that may have lost fullness due to aging, weight loss, or genetic factors. Common areas for fat grafting include the cheeks, under the eyes, temples, and lips.</p>

                    <ul class="lh">
                        <li><strong>Natural Results: </strong>Since the procedure uses your body’s own fat, the results often look more natural compared to synthetic fillers. The fat integrates with surrounding tissue, creating a smooth and natural appearance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long-Lasting Effects:</strong> While some of the injected fat may be absorbed by the body, a significant amount usually remains, providing long-lasting results compared to traditional dermal fillers.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Minimally Invasive:</strong> The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia with minimal incisions, resulting in reduced recovery time and less risk of complications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dual Benefit:</strong>  Facial fat grafting in Gurgaon not only enhances facial volume but also allows for body contouring by removing fat from areas such as the abdomen, thighs, or flanks.</li>

       <div class="procedurePoints mb-3">
       <h5 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Consultation</h5>
       <div class="lh">
       Before undergoing face fat grafting, you will have a consultation with a qualified plastic surgeon or dermatologist. During this appointment, you will discuss your goals, medical history, and the areas you wish to enhance. The surgeon will evaluate your facial structure and determine the amount of fat needed for optimal results.
       </div>
       </div>
       <div class="procedurePoints mb-3">
       <h5 class=" fw-bold">Fat Extraction</h5>
       <div class="lh">
       The first step of the procedure involves harvesting fat from a donor site, usually through liposuction. The surgeon will make small incisions in the targeted area, using a thin tube (cannula) to gently extract the fat.
       </div>
       </div>
       <div class="procedurePoints mb-3">
       <h5 class=" fw-bold">Purification</h5>
       <div class="lh">
       Once the fat is harvested, it undergoes a purification process to separate healthy fat cells from any impurities, ensuring only the best quality fat is used for injection.
       </div>
       </div>
       <div class="procedurePoints mb-3">
       <h5 class=" fw-bold">Injection</h5>
       <div class="lh">
       The purified fat is then carefully injected into the desired areas of the face using a fine needle or cannula. The surgeon will strategically place the fat to achieve a balanced and natural look.

                    <h2 class="h1 fw-bold text-center text-uppercase">Recovery and Results</h2>
                    <p class="lh">After the procedure, patients may experience some swelling, bruising, or discomfort in both the donor and injection sites. These symptoms typically subside within a week. Most patients can return to their normal activities within a few days, although full results may take several weeks to become apparent as swelling subsides and the fat settles.</p>
                    <p class="lh">
                    The results of facial fat grafting in Gurgaon can last for several years, depending on various factors such as the individual’s metabolism and lifestyle. Regular follow-ups with your surgeon will help monitor your progress and ensure optimal outcomes.
