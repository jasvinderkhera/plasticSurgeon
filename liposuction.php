                    <p class="lh">Liposuction, also called lipoplasty, is a popular cosmetic surgery that removes extra fat from certain parts of the body to create a more attractive shape. It makes you look more toned and well-proportioned.</p>

                    <p class="lh">Lipo Surgery involves the use of a suction technique to remove fat from targeted areas such as the abdomen, hips, thighs, buttocks, arms, or neck. The goal is to sculpt and refine body contours that are resistant to diet and exercise. </p>
                    <p class="lh">The best candidates for fat Removal surgery are people who are at a stable weight but have areas of fat that they want to reduce. It’s important to be in good health and have realistic expectations about the results. Liposuction is not a weight loss solution, but it can help refine and enhance body contours.</p>

            <h2 class=" text-uppercase fw-bold">How Does Liposuction Work?</h2>
            <p class="lh">Lipo is a procedure where a surgeon uses a suction device to remove fat from specific areas of the body. The surgeon makes small cuts in the skin and inserts a thin tube called a cannula. The cannula is connected to a vacuum that sucks out the fat from the targeted area.  Common areas treated by liposuction include:</p>
        <ul class="lh ps-4">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Abdomen: </strong>Stomach area</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Hips: </strong>Sides of the waist</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Thighs: </strong> Upper legs</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Buttocks: </strong>Lower back area</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Arms: </strong>Upper arms</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Neck: </strong>Area under the chin</li>

            <h2 class="h1 text-uppercase fw-bold">Why Do People Get Liposuction?</h2>

        <ul class="lh ps-4">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Shape the Body: </strong>Create a more defined and attractive silhouette.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Boost Confidence: </strong>Improve self-esteem and body image.</li>
