                    <p class="lh">Breast augmentation is a popular choice to enhance the size, shape, and symmetry of a woman’s breasts. Whether you want to increase volume, restore balance, or achieve a more youthful contour, It offers a customizable solution tailored to your unique goals.</p>

                    <p class="lh">So, what exactly is it? Well, breast increasing surgery also known as augmentation mammoplasty or big boob surgery, involves the surgical placement of implants to improve breast size and shape. This procedure is ideal for women who feel their breasts are too small, uneven, or have lost volume due to factors such as weight loss, pregnancy, or aging.</p>

        <h2 class="h1 text-uppercase fw-bold">types of implants</h2>
        <p class="lh">There are two primary types of breast implants used in augmentation:</p>
        <ul class="lh ps-2 ps-md-4">
            <li><strong>Saline Implants: </strong>Filled with sterile salt water, saline implants are adjustable and provide a firm feel. In the rare case of a leak, the body absorbs the saline solution naturally.</li>
            <li><strong>Silicone Implants: </strong>These are filled with silicone gel, which feels more like natural breast tissue. Silicone implants are popular for their soft and natural look.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lh">When considering breast implants, deciding between saline and silicone comes down to your goals, body type, and preferences for look, feel, and maintenance.</p>
        <p class="lh">For example, saline implants (filled with a sterile saltwater solution) tend to be firmer than silicone. They can look rounder and may feel less natural, particularly in patients with smaller amounts of natural breast tissue. On the other hand, silicone implants are known for their more natural feel and appearance, and they closely mimic the texture of natural breast tissue. This makes them popular among those looking for a softer, fuller look.</p>
        <p class="lh">Consulting with a certified plastic surgeon for breast augmentation in Gurgaon can help clarify which implant type best aligns with your aesthetic goals, lifestyle, and body type.</p>

                    <h2 class=" fw-bold text-uppercase">The procedure</h2>
                    <p class="lh">The breast augmentation in Gurgaon typically takes between one to two hours and is performed under general anesthesia. Your surgeon will make an incision in one of three possible locations: under the breast fold, around the areola, or in the armpit. The chosen incision site depends on your anatomy and the type of implant used. Once the implants are placed, the incisions are closed with sutures, and the recovery process begins.</p>

                   <p class="lh text-center">Recovery from this surgery usually involves a few days of rest, with most patients resuming normal activities within a week. You may experience some swelling, bruising, and discomfort, but these symptoms typically subside within a few weeks. The final results of your breast augmentation will become more apparent as your body heals and the implants settle into their new position.</p>
