                    <p class="lh">Axillary breast tissue, also known as accessory breast tissue, is an extra breast tissue that can develop in the underarm area. This condition is more common in women but can also occur in men. It can cause discomfort, pain, and self-consciousness due to its appearance, especially when the tissue becomes enlarged during hormonal changes, such as puberty, pregnancy, or menstruation. Axillary breast tissue removal is a surgical procedure designed to remove this extra tissue and restore a more natural contour to the underarm area.</p>

<!-- Causes and Symptoms -->
<section class="x-section pb-3">
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="h1 fw-bold text-uppercase">Causes and Symptoms </h2>
        <p class="lh">Axillary breast tissue develops when breast tissue forms outside the normal breast area, typically in the armpit (axilla). This can occur due to genetic factors or during fetal development when the mammary ridge, or milk line, does not regress fully. The symptoms include:</p>
        <ul class="lh ps-3">
            <li>A noticeable bulge or swelling in the underarm area.</li>
            <li>Pain or discomfort, particularly during hormonal changes.</li>
            <li>Sensitivity or tenderness in the affected area.</li>
            <li>Difficulty with clothing fit due to the extra tissue.</li>

                    <h2 class="h1 fw-bold text-uppercase">The Surgical Procedure</h2>
                    <p class="lh">Axillary breast removal is typically performed as an outpatient procedure under general or local anesthesia. The surgeon will make an incision in the natural fold of the underarm to access the excess tissue. The tissue is then carefully removed, and any excess skin may also be excised to ensure a smooth contour. The incision is then closed with sutures, and a compression garment is often recommended to minimize swelling and support the healing process.</p>

                    <h2 class=" fw-bold text-center text-uppercase mb-3">Recovery Process </h2>
                    <p class="lh mb-3">Recovery from axillary breast removal surgery is usually straightforward. Patients can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort in the days following the procedure, but these symptoms typically subside within a week or two. It’s important to follow your surgeon’s post-operative care instructions, which may include:</p>
                        <ul class="lh ps-4">
                            <li class="mb-2">Wearing a compression garment to reduce swelling.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a few weeks.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Keeping the surgical site clean and dry to prevent infection.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="lh">Most patients can return to their normal activities within a few days, but it’s recommended to avoid rigorous exercise for at least four to six weeks.</p>
