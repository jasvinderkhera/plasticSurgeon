                    <p class="lh"><strong>Tummy tuck surgery</strong>, or <strong>abdominoplasty</strong>, is a cosmetic procedure aimed at improving the appearance of the abdomen. This surgery is popular among individuals who have excess skin and fat in the abdominal area or weakened muscles due to aging, pregnancy, significant weight loss, or genetic factors.</p>

                    <p class="lh">The primary goal of loose skin surgery is to remove excess skin and fat from the middle and lower abdomen. The procedure also tightens the muscles of the abdominal wall, resulting in a flatter and firmer abdomen. It enhances the overall appearance of the abdominal area, providing a more toned and youthful look. </p>

                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> The loose skin surgery begins with the administration of anesthesia. General anesthesia is typically used to ensure the patient is comfortable and pain-free during the procedure.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Incisions:</strong> The surgeon makes incisions to remove excess skin and fat and to tighten abdominal muscles. The length and shape of the incision depend on the amount of excess skin to be removed.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Reshaping and Suturing:</strong> The abdominal muscles are pulled together and stitched in place. The skin is then stretched down, and excess skin is trimmed.</li>
                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Closing Incisions:</strong> The incisions are closed with sutures, skin adhesives, or clips. The surgeon may place temporary drainage tubes to remove excess fluid and reduce swelling.</li>
