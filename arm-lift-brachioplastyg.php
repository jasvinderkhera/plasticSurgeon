                    <ul class="lh">
                        <li><strong>Eliminate Sagging Skin: </strong>Aging, significant weight loss, or genetic factors can lead to loose, hanging skin on the upper arms. An arm lift removes this excess skin, giving your arms a firmer, more youthful appearance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhance Arm Contours: </strong>By removing excess fat and tightening the underlying tissues, an arm lift improves the shape of your arms, providing a more defined and sculpted look.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boost Confidence: </strong>Many people feel self-conscious about the appearance of their arms, especially when wearing sleeveless clothing. An arm lift can help you feel more comfortable and confident in your skin.</li>

        <h2 class="h1 fw-bold text-uppercase">The Arm Lift Procedure </h2>
        <p class="lh">The arm lift procedure typically involves the following steps:</p>
        <ul class="lh ps-3">
            <li><strong>Consultation: </strong>During your initial consultation, your surgeon will discuss your goals, evaluate your arm anatomy, and determine the best approach for your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Anesthesia: </strong>On the day of the surgery, anesthesia is administered to ensure your comfort during the procedure.</li>
            <li><strong>Incisions: </strong>Depending on the extent of correction needed, incisions are made on the inside or back of the arm. The length and pattern of the incision will vary based on the amount and location of excess skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Tissue Removal and Tightening: </strong>Excess skin is removed, and the underlying tissues are tightened and reshaped. Liposuction may be used to remove any additional fat deposits.</li>
            <li><strong>Closing Incisions: </strong>The incisions are carefully closed with sutures, and the area is bandaged to support healing.</li>
        </ul>
