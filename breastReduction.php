                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Surgery:</strong> During the procedure, excess breast tissue, fat, and skin are removed to achieve the desired breast size. The nipples and areolas are often repositioned for a natural look.</li>

                        <li class="pb-2"><strong>Recovery:</strong>  Post-surgery, patients will experience swelling and discomfort, which can be managed with pain medication. Most people can return to work and normal activities within a few weeks, but it may take several months for the breasts to settle into their final shape.</li>
